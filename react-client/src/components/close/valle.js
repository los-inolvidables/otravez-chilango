        <p>Valle de Bravo is a town and municipality located in State of Mexico, Mexico. It is located on the shore of Lake Avándaro, approximately 156 km southwest of Mexico City and west of Toluca on highways 15, 134 or 1. It takes about 2 hours to drive from Mexico City to Valle de Bravo, making it a popular weekend getaway for the capital's affluent upper class.
        </p>
        <p>The town has several names during its history including San Francisco del Valle de Temascaltepec, Temascaltepec de indios, Villa del Valle, and San Francisco del Valle. The original names including Temascaltepec caused confusion with the nearby "Real de Minas de Temascaltepec", now Temascaltepec, so the county was known as "El Valle" (The Valley). The honorific "de Bravo" was added later to recognize Nicolás Bravo who fought at the Castle of Chapultepec during the Mexican-American War. Its glyph[disambiguation needed] includes the image of a temazcal in reference to its original name
        </p>
        <p>In 1971 Valle de Bravo was known as typical city (ciudad típica) and magical town (pueblo mágico) in 2005. The town and the surrounding area are well known in Mexico as a tourist destination, mainly because it is only 2 hours away from Mexico City and for having hosted the world-famous events Circuito Avandaro (auto racing event) and Festival de rock y Ruedas (a massive rock music festival)
